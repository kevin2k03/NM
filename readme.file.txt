Problem Definition :
The Smart Noise project aims to address the growing concern of noise pollution in urban environments by deploying IoT sensors on to measure noise levels in public areas. The project's primary goal is to provide real-time noise data to the public through a user-friendly platform or mobile app. By doing so, it seeks to raise awareness about noise pollution and empower individuals and communities to make informed decisions to mitigate its impact. Understanding the Project
